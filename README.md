#### a [website] i find interesting (https://experiments.withgoogle.com/)

###### why i find it interesting
this is a website i love to browse and gain inspiration for my own creative technical projects, as it has a whole collection of great implemented ideas on AI, AR, VR, Voice experiements, Android and cool Chrome extensions.

you don't have to be a part of Google to submit your own experiments, and this is an exciting open-source platform for both coders and designers alike to share projects, look at and try out the cool stuff other people are working on

i also love the heavy usage of the word 'experiment' because it frames the place in a playful way, and that is essentially what i feel like tech should be, people should not be afraid to create new things, or to make mistakes
